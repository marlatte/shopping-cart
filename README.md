# Shopping Cart: Yuedpao

A mock e-commerce website built with React. Site design inspired by Conor Marlatt's wireframe for Thai clothing company Yuedpao.

This project demonstrates my skills with:

- Single-Page Applications with React Router
  - v6 data APIs
  - Actions & data submission
  - Loaders & url-based components
  - Error catching
  - Fetchers & optimistic UI
  - Outlet Context
- React testing with `vitest` and `@testing-library/react`
- Fetching data in React from FakeStore API
- Styling with CSS Modules
