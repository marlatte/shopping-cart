# Shopping Cart

A mock e-commerce website built with React demonstrating my skills with:

- React Router with `react-router-dom`
- React testing with `vitest` and `@testing-library/react`
- Fetching data in React from FakeStore API

Project requirements can be found on [the Odin Project site](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).
